It was developed in 2006 by Jeremy Siek and Walid Taha. Dynamic type systems offer complete flexibility and agility; whereas static typing offers type-related error detection earlier. Gradual typing allows us to declare types as dynamic and also specify types. Moreover, we can coerce types to and from dynamic throughout its execution.
I won&amp;#39;t be going over Gradual Typing too closely, because Professor Siek has his very own excellent blog you should give a read if you&amp;#39;re interested.</description></item><item><title>About Me</title><link>https://cjohnson19.github.io/about/</link><pubDate>Mon, 06 Dec 2021 23:03:37 -0600</pubDate><guid>https://cjohnson19.github.io/about/</guid><description>I&amp;#39;m pursuing my MS in Computer Science at University of Minnesota where I was awarded my BS in 2020. I have a focus in programming languages and theory. More specifically, my academic interests lie in functional languages, reasoning correctness, and proof assistants.</description></item><item><title>Polymorphism</title><link>https://cjohnson19.github.io/posts/polymorphism/</link><pubDate>Mon, 06 Dec 2021 20:03:32 -0600</pubDate><guid>https://cjohnson19.github.io/posts/polymorphism/</guid><description>Introduction Polymorphism is often seen as a characteristic unique to Object Oriented Programming (OOP) or at least one that it thrives in. Many have only seen polymorphism through the lens of an object oriented language and have yet to see other approaches to defining common interfaces.
I&amp;#39;ll be using Java and Standard ML (SML) to demonstrate the various types of polymorphism. Java is unique in its pervasiveness throughout professional developers and its usage as a language to teach OOP.</description></item><item><title>Functional Language Correctness</title><link>https://cjohnson19.github.io/posts/functional-language-correctness/</link><pubDate>Mon, 06 Dec 2021 18:35:32 -0600</pubDate><guid>https://cjohnson19.github.io/posts/functional-language-correctness/</guid><description>Introduction What is Functional Programming? If you already have experienced functional programming, or feel like you have a good grasp on its concepts, feel free to jump ahead to the next sub section on OCaml. This will only be review for you.
If you have never heard of functional programming, take some time to ponder on the design and don&amp;#39;t jump to conclusions.
My first time using a functional language was much like my first time programming recursively.</description></item></channel></rss>
